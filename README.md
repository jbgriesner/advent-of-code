This repository is my personal participation to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/). This is a full Haskell solution. Feel free to check `/src` folder to see implementations.

Final Result is:

```

     part2: 13693
--- result of day 3 is:
     part1: 7831
     part2: 2683
--- result of day 4 is:
     part1: 464
     part2: 770
--- result of day 5 is:
